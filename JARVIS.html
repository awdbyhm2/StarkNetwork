            "The latest batch of experimental repulsor technology is still in the testing phase. It would be wise to review the data before you decide to use it for impromptu 'field exercises.'",
            "Sir, your scheduled meeting with the board is in one hour. I’ve taken the liberty of preparing a presentation on the Stark Industries' quarterly performance. You may want to avoid impromptu jokes about the competition.",
            "Reminder: You haven’t updated your personal security protocols in over 3 weeks. While I’ve been doing my best, some additional encryption wouldn’t hurt.",
            "The clean-up crew is still waiting for you to return the prototype you borrowed last week. I believe they refer to it as 'the Stark-sized mess.'",

            "Reminder: You’ve left the Mark LXXXVI armor exposed to atmospheric elements for 48 hours. While it can withstand it, prolonged exposure will cause wear and tear, particularly on the plating.",

            "A brief note: Your last attempt at a ‘quick’ workout session resulted in a strained rotator cuff. I’ve adjusted your gym schedule accordingly, but perhaps a more structured approach would prevent further injuries.",

            "I’ve noticed that the garage is once again full of new projects. Would you like me to arrange for a storage solution, or should I anticipate more spontaneous testing sessions with minimal regard for cleanup?",
            "Your scheduled downtime was set for 8 hours ago. I would strongly advise you to take a break. Your energy levels are beginning to dip below optimal, and excessive work could impact your performance.",
            "Sir, I’ve reviewed your calendar for the upcoming week. It seems you’ve scheduled four simultaneous meetings at Stark Industries. Shall I prioritize the one that involves minimal 'entertainment' value?",
            "I’ve taken the liberty of ordering your favorite takeout for dinner. Based on your previous eating habits, I recommend the spicy Asian fusion. Would you like me to place an extra order for Pepper, or should I allow her to make her own decision?",
            "I’ve detected a minor malfunction in your suit's external thrusters. Nothing catastrophic, but you might want to avoid any high-speed maneuvers until it's resolved.",
